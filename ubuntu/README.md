# Quick ubuntu dev environment setup
*Notice*: Unfortunately requires root privilege access. I'm afraid no easy way around that!

1. installs prerequisite packages
2. installs lxde-core as minimal gui
3. installs tigervncserver for rpd
4. installs openblas
5. installs theano and torch depending your choice

*Todo:*

1. port it for arch linux (not tested yet)
2. port it for OS X

*Tested:*
- Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 codename xenial.
